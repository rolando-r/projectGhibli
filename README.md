## Studio Ghibli Parallax Effect Project 🌌🎥

Welcome to the Studio Ghibli Parallax Effect Project! In this project, we will explore how to create a parallax effect using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, while incorporating iconic characters from Studio Ghibli movies to bring our web page to life. 🪄🌟

## Description

The goal of this project is to showcase how a parallax effect can be achieved, where background elements move at different speeds than foreground elements as you scroll. Additionally, we'll add the magic of Studio Ghibli characters 🧙‍♂️🌸 to give a charming touch to the experience.

## Skills 🛠
HTML: Basic page structure.

CSS: Styling for layout and elements.

JavaScript: Controlling the parallax effect and interactivity.

## How It Works 🔄
The parallax effect is achieved by moving background and foreground layers at different speeds while scrolling. The parallax.js file contains the JavaScript code controlling this effect. Studio Ghibli's background images can be found in the img/ folder.
